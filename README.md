# RShiny

This App analyzes how the topic of the UFC is interacted with on social media, primarily using Twitter and YouTube data. Using R I collected thousands
of tweets with the hastag #UFC to conduct sentimetal analysis analyzing the different emotions of each tweet, create a semantic network, hashtag network, 
as well as a geomap based on users geolocation. I also used the hashtag #UFC in order to create a YouTube network in order to analyze which channels 
related to the UFC are most popular, and most likely to be recommended to UFC fans watching similar vidoes.
